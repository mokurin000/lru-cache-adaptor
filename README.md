## LRU Cache adaptor

Helper crate for `disklru`, mainly for lack of documentation.

Prefer [`foyer`](https://docs.rs/foyer/latest/foyer/) for a even mature hybird cache solution, with LRU rotation and filesystem backend storage.

Check examples for how to integrate it for file-system backend file storage.
